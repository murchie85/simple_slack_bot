## SUMMARY 

We are going to build a bot using node, which we will run from our own machine. It will interface with two APIs, so that when the user asks for a joke we will return the joke from the API in the slack channel.


## RESOURCES

### SLACKBOT API

Link [here](https://github.com/mishk0/slack-bot-api) , you can install this easily from command line by running `npm install slackbots` .
